# Python-Playground-Book

This repository contains my adapted code for select projects in the book "Python Playground - Geeky Porjects for the Curious Programmer" by Mahesh Venkitachalam.

The majority of the code is directly from the book but I have made some changes and experimented with some of the functionality to help me learn more about the various modules used in the book such as numpy, scupy and matplotlib.

conway.py: implements Venkitachalam's verision of the legendary mathematical problem Conway's Game of Life

ascii_art.py: uses a grayscale ramp to convert regular images to text files that look like the original image when zoomed out

out.txt: output file for ascii_art.py

tank.jpg: sample image for ascii_ary.py

boids.py: implements the Boids Algorithm (a.k.a. flocking algorithm) that models the flight of a group of birds

Python_Playground_Book.pdf: pdf version of Venkitachalam's book
