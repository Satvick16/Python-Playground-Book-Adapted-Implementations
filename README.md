# Python-Playground-Book

This repository contains my adapted code for select projects in the book "Python Playground - Geeky Porjects for the Curious Programmer" by Mahesh Venkitachalam.

I credit this book with helping me learn object-oriented-programming in Python. It kickstarted my journey to create programming projects of my own and experiement with moduls and libraries like Pillow, matplotlib and numpy.

conway.py: implements Venkitachalam's verision of the legendary mathematical problem Conway's Game of Life

ascii_art.py: uses a grayscale ramp to convert regular images to text files that look like the original image when zoomed out

out.txt: output file for ascii_art.py

tank.jpg: sample image for ascii_ary.py

Python_Playground_Book.pdf: pdf version of Venkitachalam's book
